# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  hello: "Hello world"
  style_guide:
    1_overview:
      01_overview: This is the living styleguide for Curri. It may be modified after discussion with other team members.
      02_coding_style: "&#8226; Use soft-tabs with a two space indent.<br />&#8226; Put spaces after `:` in property declarations.<br /> &#8226; Put spaces before `{` in rule declarations.<br />&#8226; Use hex color codes `#000` unless using `rgba`.<br />&#8226; Use `//` for comment blocks (instead of `/* */`)."
      03_Sass_style:
      04_file_organization:
    2_branding:
      01_typography: "The app is built using only [Source Sans Pro](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) from Google Fonts. There are 4 defined header elements, `<h1>` through `<h4>`, as well as the basic paragraph `<p>`."
      02_colors: "This is the color palette used throughout the app. For ease of use and consistency, all colors are defined as variables in `app/assets/stylesheets/_variables.scss` and should be used as such."
    3_buttons:
      01_styles: "Regular buttons should be used for forms and primary actions. Use the `.btn` class to style buttons, and add any of the additional `.btn-primary`,`,btn-success`,`.btn-warning` or `.btn-danger` classes as needed."
      02_sizes: We only use two button sizes- the default larger size and a smaller size. The small buttons should be used for secondary actions- to open new pages and modals. Use the `.btn-small` class to change the appearance.
      03_button_tags: "The different button classes can be used on `<a>`, `<button>`, or `<input>` elements. <br /><br />**Note:** As a best practice, it is recommended to use the `<button>` element whenever possible to ensure matching cross-browser rendering. Among other things, there's a Firefox bug that prevents us from setting the line-height of `<input>`-based buttons, causing them to not exactly match the height of other buttons on Firefox."
      04_disabled: "On button and input elements, use the `disabled` attribute to disable the button action. On anchor elements use the `.disabled` class to achieve the same effect. <br /><br /> **Note:** Link functionality will not be disabled, and will need to be done through javascript. If you add the disabled attribute to a `<button>`, IE 9 and below will render text gray with a nasty text-shadow."
