        <h3>A Living Roadmap</h3>
        <p>Teachers need to clearly communicate learning expectations. A dynamic interface allows them to easily add, edit or rearrange goals. Students always know what is happening, where they are going and where they have been.</p>

        <h3>Continual Self-Assessment</h3>
        <p>Successful students think about their own learning, monitor their understanding and assume responsibility for their education. Curri encourages students to be engaged in ongoing self-assessment using learning expectations and success criteria. When things really do get out of hand Curri has a private “raise your hand” feature that places students in a queue to get help.</p>
